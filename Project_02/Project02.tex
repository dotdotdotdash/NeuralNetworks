\begin{abstract}
In this project we were given a time series prediction problem in which 275 data points have been given which are measurements of the physical variable y(n) where n denotes year, the given data can be seen in fig. 1 below. The task is to predict the following 30 data points for y(276),...,y(305). Using Neural Net tool box of MATLAB, we have solved the time series prediction problem by training n-layered neural-net with the (lm) algorithm and using early stopping.
